# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for. Include any badges or status labels if applicable.
Start with a compelling one-liner that captures the essence of your project. Why should someone care?

## Introduction

Provide an overview of the project, its purpose, and potential benefits. Mention the technologies used and any interesting features or challenges faced during development.
Instead of a simple introduction, directly address the reader's needs. What can your project do for them that no other project can?

## Repository Structure

- **src/**: Contains all the source code.
  - `main.py`: The main entry point for the program.
- **data/**: Data files used or generated by the project.
- **docs/**: Documentation files, including generated API docs.
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests for the project.
- **examples/**: Example scripts and usage demonstrations.

`requirements.txt`: Lists all dependencies for easy installation.

## Quick Started

Jump straight to getting the project running. People love instant gratification, so make this as simple as three commands or fewer.

**Example:**
```bash
git clone https://yourprojectlink.git
cd yourprojectname
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Detailed Setup

### Prerequisites

List any prerequisites, libraries, or tools that need to be installed before running the project.
Only list what's absolutely necessary. Consider providing alternatives or shortcuts.

**Example:**
*We recommend using PyCharm or VS Code to work with the code.*
*We also assume that you have some version of Python installed. We developed using Python 3.10, but other versions should work as well.*

### Installation

Offer a variety of installation methods: traditional, Docker, one-liner scripts, etc. Cater to both novices and experts.

**Example:**

Step-by-step guide on setting up the project locally.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the repository in your IDE.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but we strongly recommend it)
    - Creation: Run `python -m venv venv` in the terminal
    - Activation: 
      - Windows: Run `.\venv\Scripts\activate` in the terminal
      - Unix: Run `source ./venv/bin/activate` in the terminal (we think, not actually tested)
    - Deactivation (if necessary): Run `deactivate` in the terminal
4. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.
5. You are ready to go.
